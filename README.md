# Another Learning Project

This project is supposed to help me learn how to use Golang + Postgres + Kubernetes + gRPC by building a banking
application lol. 

DAY 1:

Used dbdiagrams.io to design a database schema. Will attach PDF and SQL commands in codebase

DAY 2:

Learnt how to use Docker, download images, create containers, execute some sql commands via docker in terminal. Learnt
how to use TablePlus to run commands is postgres environment

DAY 3:

Learnt database migration using the golang/migrate tool. Learnt about up-down migration which is apparently best practice for database migration. The up script is run when we want to make a forward change to the schema and the down script is run when we want to reverse a change to the schema
